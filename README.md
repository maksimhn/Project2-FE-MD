This project is essentially a simple guessing game which presents you random German noun with a visual description and offers to guess this word's gender: masculine, feminine or neutral. In order to play the quiz a user must be registered and logged in. User may also delete its data and correct a word's gender should it be presented incorrectly.
Client-side app is currently hosted on GitHub Pages service, server side is deployed on Heroku.
Server-side repo can be found here:

The client-side app is based on the following technologies:
- HTML5 and CSS3 (Materializecss framework with custom CSS layer on the top)
- Javascript with the following additional libraries:
    jQuery for DOM manipulation
    Chart.js for stats representation (based on canvas)
- AJAX requests communicate via JSON data objects

During the development process I took into account the following priorities:
Front-end must be visually appealing and fun to use to compensate the overall depression attributed to learning a new language.
It must be simple enough to avoid possible confusion since a considerable share of target audience may consist of children.
Database should be expandable and accessible, there should be no hardcoded parameters on the client side to support that.

Due to project's simplicity one-page design is sufficient for the core functionality.
